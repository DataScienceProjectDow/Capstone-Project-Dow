# Backgroud

This repository is for a Data Science Capstone Project collaborated between Dow Inc. and University of Washington and associated with a course of ChemE 547 offer at UW.

This project is developed by Meenal Rawlani, Andrew Simon and Shijie Zhang.

# Overview

NLP Maps is an algorithm designed to select the optimal word embedding method for a given task. In its final state, it will be able to select an ensemble of embedding methods to determine the best series of embedding methods used. In its current state, several trained models on the IMDB dataset are available to be measured using Word2vec, Bert, ELMO, and Glove embedding methods. The .py scripts in the nlpmaps folder are modular and can be applied to any sentiment analysis task. Demonstrations on how to fine tune the model to a given data set can be found in jupyter notebooks in the examples folder. Further examples of how to implement the py scripts can be found in the examples folder as well.
