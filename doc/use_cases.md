### Probable Use Case

The user in this case will be a data scientist who takes the embedded text into a model for further data processing and analysis. They wish to take data from various machines and reactors involved in a chemical plant and convert it into a form that is directly accessible for further processing and is uniform across reactors. The tool needs to assess the situation and use the best possible method of text embedding. The user is highly skilled. (ETL)
