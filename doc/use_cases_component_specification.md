## Possible Use Cases:

1. **Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Content:** The package could be used to analyze social media posts to determine the overall sentiment towards a particular topic, product, or event. For example, a company could use it to analyze customer sentiment towards their brand or a specific product they have launched.

2. **Automated Customer Support:** The package could be used to classify customer support requests based on their content. This could be used to automatically route the requests to the appropriate department or individual, saving time and improving customer service.

3. **Product Reviews Analysis:** Businesses could use the package to analyze product reviews from e-commerce websites to understand what aspects of the product customers like or dislike.

4. **News Classification:** Media organizations could use the package to classify news articles into categories, making it easier for users to find the news they're interested in.

## Component Specification:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **What it does:** Cleans the raw text data by removing irrelevant information and
standardizing text format to prepare it for feature extraction and machine learning.

- **Inputs:** Raw text data, optional customized list of stop words, optional specification of date/time format.

- **Outputs:** Cleaned and preprocessed text data ready for embedding.

- **Possible sub-components:** Stop Words Remover, Punctuation Remover, Date and Time Remover and Lowercase Converter. 

### 2. Text Embedding

- **What it does:** Converts the cleaned text data into numerical format using one of the seven word embedding models. This step is crucial to feed text data into machine learning algorithms.

- **Inputs:** Cleaned and preprocessed text data.

- **Outputs:** Numerical vector representations of the text data.

- **Possible sub-components:** Word2Vec Embedder, GloVe Embedder, and FastText Embedder, etc.

### 3. Model Selection

- **What it does:** Evaluates the performance of different machine learning models trained on the embeddings using the specified metrics, and selects the best-performing model.

- **Inputs:** Embeddings of the text data, specified metrics (default metrics if not specified by user), labels if available (for supervised tasks).

- **Outputs:** Best-performing model, embeddings of the data, classifier which performs best with the embeddings.

- **Possible sub-components:** Model Trainer, Model Evaluator, and Model Selector.
